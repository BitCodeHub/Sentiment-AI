# Solution: 174 Reviews Issue ✅

## Root Cause
The frontend was showing **cached data** with 174 reviews. The backend was working correctly but the frontend had `useCache: true` which returned old cached results.

## What I Fixed

### 1. Backend Date Filtering (Already Working)
- Added date range filtering to hybrid endpoint
- Filters combined RSS + API results by requested date range
- **Status**: ✅ Deployed and working

### 2. Frontend Cache Issue (Just Fixed)
Changed in `EnhancedDashboard.jsx`:
```javascript
// From:
useCache: true,
forceRefresh: false,

// To:
useCache: false,
forceRefresh: true,
```

## Expected Results After Frontend Deployment

When you select different date ranges:
- **Last 90 days**: ~182 reviews (not 174)
- **Last 85 days**: 174 reviews (this was the cached range)
- **All time**: 6,669 reviews

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for frontend deployment** (2-3 minutes on Render)
2. **Hard refresh the page** (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. **Select your date range** and it should show correct review counts

## If Still Showing 174 Reviews

Clear browser storage manually:
```javascript
// Run in browser console
indexedDB.deleteDatabase('AppleReviewsCache');
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```

## The "All Ratings" 0.0 Issue
This is a separate issue. The API is returning rating data but it's not displaying correctly in the UI. The summarizations endpoint is working (returns data for 182 reviews) but needs frontend display fix.
