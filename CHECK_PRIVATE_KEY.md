# Check Your Private Key Encoding

Based on the diagnostics, your `APPLE_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64` is only 321 characters, which seems too short.

## Correct Way to Encode Your .p8 File

### On Mac (Recommended):
```bash
# This puts the base64 string in your clipboard
cat AuthKey_XXXXXX.p8 | base64 | tr -d '\n' | pbcopy
```

**Important**: The `tr -d '\n'` removes newlines to create one long string.

### Alternative Method:
```bash
# This shows the base64 string on screen
base64 -i AuthKey_XXXXXX.p8 | tr -d '\n'
```

## What the Result Should Look Like

A properly encoded .p8 file should:
- Be approximately 400-500 characters long
- Be one continuous string with NO line breaks
- Start with something like: `LS0tLS1CRUdJTi...`
- End with something like: `...S0tLS0K`

## Common Mistakes

1. **Using the file content directly** instead of base64 encoding
2. **Including line breaks** in the base64 string
3. **Copying only part of the output**
4. **Using quotes** around the value in Render

## Quick Test

After re-encoding and updating on Render:
1. The `APPLE_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64` length should show ~400-500 chars
2. `storedCredentialsValid` should become `true`
3. The dropdown will appear!

## In Render Dashboard

Make sure you paste ONLY the base64 string, with:
- ❌ No quotes
- ❌ No line breaks
- ❌ No spaces at start/end
- ✅ Just the long base64 string
