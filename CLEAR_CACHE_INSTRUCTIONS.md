# Clear Cache to Fix 174 Reviews Issue ðŸ”„

## The Problem
The frontend is showing cached data with 174 reviews. The backend fix is deployed and working correctly, but the frontend is using `useCache: true` which returns old cached data.

## Solution: Clear the Cache

### Method 1: Force Refresh in the App
1. In the dashboard, look for a **Refresh** button (ðŸ”„ icon)
2. Click it to force refresh the data
3. This should bypass the cache and fetch fresh data

### Method 2: Clear Browser Storage
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12 or right-click â†’ Inspect)
2. Go to **Application** tab
3. In the left sidebar, find **Storage**
4. Click **Clear site data**
5. Refresh the page

### Method 3: Manual Cache Clear
In the browser console, run:
```javascript
// Clear all review caches
indexedDB.deleteDatabase('AppleReviewsCache');
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();

// Reload the page
location.reload();
```

### Method 4: Modify the Code (Temporary)
If you can modify the code, temporarily change line 242 in `EnhancedDashboard.jsx`:
```javascript
// Change from:
forceRefresh: false, // Use cache when available for better performance

// To:
forceRefresh: true, // Force fresh data
```

## What Should Happen
After clearing the cache:
- **Last 90 days**: Should show ~182 reviews (not 174)
- **All time**: Should show 6,669 reviews
- **All Ratings**: Should show actual rating data (not 0.0)

## Backend is Working Correctly âœ…
Tests confirm:
- Backend date filtering is deployed and working
- Last 90 days (2025-06-16 to 2025-09-14) returns 182 reviews
- Last 85 days (2025-06-21 to 2025-09-14) returns 174 reviews
- The 174 reviews you're seeing is likely cached from an earlier query

The issue is purely frontend caching - the backend is returning the correct data!
