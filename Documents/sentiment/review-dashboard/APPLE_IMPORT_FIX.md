# Apple Import Date Range Fix

## Issue
When users clicked "Import from Apple App Store" and selected a date range, the app would get stuck showing "Loading data for selected date range..." and never proceed to import the data.

## Root Causes
1. The AppleImport.jsx file was empty, breaking the import functionality
2. The loading state from EnhancedDashboard was being triggered during import
3. No support for date range selection in the import flow
4. No immediate data loading after date selection

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Restored AppleImport Component
- Restored the full AppleImport component from backup
- Added support for date range selection
- Added support for server-configured credentials

### 2. Added Date Range Selection
- Users can now select a date range before importing
- Date range is saved to session storage
- Dashboard automatically loads data for the selected range

### 3. Server Credentials Support
- Auto-detects when backend has configured apps
- Shows app selection dropdown instead of manual credentials
- Supports both manual and server-configured modes

### 4. Fixed Loading State Logic
- Updated EnhancedDashboard to only show loading state when appropriate
- Added `isInitialLoad` flag to prevent premature loading messages
- Loading state only shows after initial data is loaded

### 5. Improved Import Flow
1. User selects app (or enters credentials)
2. User optionally selects date range
3. User clicks "Import Reviews"
4. Config is saved to session storage
5. Reviews are imported with date range
6. User is taken to dashboard with data

## User Experience Improvements
- **Before**: Select date → Stuck on loading screen
- **After**: Select date → Import → Dashboard loads with data

## Technical Changes
- Restored `src/components/AppleImport.jsx`
- Updated import to support date ranges
- Added date picker UI and styling
- Fixed loading state conditions in EnhancedDashboard
- Added server credentials support

The app now properly handles date range selection during import and loads data immediately into the dashboard.
