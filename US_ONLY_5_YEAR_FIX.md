# US-Only Reviews & 5-Year Support Fix ✅

## What Was Changed:

### 1. **US-Only Customer Reviews**
- **Before**: Fetching from 10 countries (US, UK, CA, AU, DE, FR, JP, IT, ES, NL)
- **After**: Fetching from **US only**
- All reviews are now exclusively from US App Store customers

### 2. **5-Year Date Range Support**
- **Before**: Limited to 90 days
- **After**: Supports up to **5 years** (1825 days)
- Respects any date range the user selects in the UI

### 3. **Fetch ALL Reviews**
- **Before**: Limited pagination (3 pages)
- **After**: 
  - RSS: Up to **10 pages** (2000 reviews)
  - API: Up to **100 pages** (20,000 reviews)
- Now fetches ALL available reviews within the selected date range

## Technical Changes:

### Backend (server.js):
- Line 1285: Changed countries from 10 to just `['us']`
- Line 1398: Changed daysToFetch from 90 to 1825 (5 years)
- Added proper date range handling from UI

### RSS Service (appleRSSService.js):
- Line 157: Increased RSS pages from 3 to 10
- Line 119: Default countries now only `['us']`

### Frontend (appleAppStoreBrowser.js):
- Line 601: Changed daysToFetch from 90 to 1825
- Line 602: Countries parameter set to 'us'

## How It Works Now:

1. **When user selects a date range**:
   - The exact dates are passed to the backend
   - Backend fetches ALL reviews within that range
   - Only from US App Store

2. **Pagination**:
   - Automatically fetches multiple pages
   - Continues until all reviews are retrieved
   - Handles up to 20,000 reviews

3. **Data Sources**:
   - RSS Feeds: Recent reviews (1-3 days old)
   - App Store API: Historical reviews (4+ days old)
   - Both limited to US only

## To Deploy:

**Backend must be redeployed**:
1. Go to Render dashboard
2. Find "sentiment-review-backend"
3. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"

## Expected Results:

- For "Last 7 Days": All US reviews from the past week
- For "Last 90 Days": All US reviews from the past 3 months
- For "Last 365 Days": All US reviews from the past year
- For "Last 5 Years": All US reviews up to 5 years back

No more country mixing, no more 90-day limits!
