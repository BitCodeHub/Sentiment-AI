# Date Range Filtering Fix ðŸ“…

## The Problem
Your dashboard was showing only 174 reviews for "last 90 days" even though the backend had 500+ reviews. The issue was that the hybrid endpoint wasn't filtering the combined results by the requested date range.

## What Was Happening
1. **RSS feeds** fetch the most recent 500 reviews (no date filtering)
2. **Apple API** fetches reviews within the requested date range (e.g., last 90 days)
3. Reviews were combined and deduplicated
4. **BUT** the final result wasn't filtered by date range
5. Frontend received all 500 reviews instead of just the ones in the date range

## The Fix
Added date range filtering to the hybrid endpoint AFTER combining RSS and API results:

```javascript
// Filter by date range if provided
let filteredReviews = uniqueReviews;
if (startDate || endDate) {
  filteredReviews = uniqueReviews.filter(review => {
    const reviewDate = new Date(review.Date);
    // Filter logic here...
  });
}
```

## Testing the Fix
After deployment (2-3 minutes), the dashboard should show the correct number of reviews for the selected date range:
- Last 90 days: ~174 reviews
- All time: 500+ reviews

## Files Updated
- `backend/server.js` - Development server
- `backend/server-production.js` - Production server

## Next Steps
1. Wait for Render to deploy the changes
2. Refresh the dashboard
3. It should now show the correct number of reviews based on your date selection

The "All Ratings (App Store Overall)" showing 0.0 is a separate issue - the Apple API summarizations endpoint is working (182 reviews) but the data might not be displayed correctly in the UI.
